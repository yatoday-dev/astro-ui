# Accessibility

## Our approach to accessibility

Accessibility isn't an afterthought in Accessible Astroâ€”it's our foundation. We follow the WAI-ARIA guidelines and WCAG 2.2 standards to ensure our components and themes work for everyone, regardless of how they interact with the web.

## Key principles

### 1. Semantic HTML

- Using proper HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Maintaining logical heading hierarchy
- Providing meaningful landmarks
- Using lists for navigation items

### 2. Keyboard navigation

- All interactive elements are focusable
- Focus order matches visual order
- Clear focus indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
- Proper tab management in modals

### 3. ARIA implementation

- Proper roles and attributes
- Dynamic content updates
- State management
- Clear labeling
- Descriptive announcements

### 4. Visual considerations

- Sufficient color contrast
- Content visible without color
- Text resizing without loss of functionality
- Responsive design that works at 400% zoom
- Support for high contrast modes

All our components meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA contrast requirements by default, with many meeting the stricter AAA level.

## User preferences

We respect user preferences through:

```css
/* Reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Motion-based animations are disabled */
}

/* Color scheme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Dark mode styles */
}

/* Contrast (coming soon) */
@media (prefers-contrast: more) {
  /* High contrast styles */
}
```

## Screen reader support

Our components are tested with popular screen readers:

- NVDA on Windows
- VoiceOver on macOS
- TalkBack on Android
- VoiceOver on iOS

We recommend testing your implementation with real screen readers to ensure the best experience for your users.

## Focus management

We handle focus carefully:

- Trapping focus in modals
- Returning focus after modal closes
- Skip links for main content
- Proper focus order in complex components
- Clear focus styles that work on all backgrounds

## Common patterns

### Buttons vs Links

```astro
<!-- Use buttons for actions -->
<button type="button" onClick={handleAction}> Perform Action </button>

<!-- Use links for navigation -->
<a href="/some-page"> Go to Page </a>
```

### Hidden content

```astro
<!-- Visually hidden but available to screen readers -->
<span class="sr-only">Additional context</span>

<!-- Hidden from all users -->
<div hidden>Not visible or announced</div>
```

### Dynamic content

```astro
<!-- Live regions for important updates -->
<div role="status" aria-live="polite">Status message</div>

<!-- Busy indicators -->
<button aria-busy="true"> Processing... </button>
```

## Best practices

1. **Test early and often**

- Use keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Verify color contrast
- Check at different zoom levels

2. **Progressive enhancement**

- Ensure basic functionality without JavaScript
- Add enhanced interactions thoughtfully
- Provide fallbacks for modern features

3. **Clear communication**

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide helpful error messages
- Include proper form labels
- Use descriptive link text

We recommend using the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` package to catch common accessibility issues during development. This plugin is already included in our starter themes:

```bash
npm install -D eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
```

## Testing tools

- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [WAVE Browser Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)

While automated tools are helpful, they can't catch all accessibility issues. Manual testing and user feedback are essential. See our [accessibility testing](/accessibility-testing) page for more information.
