# About

Everything you need to rapidly build content-driven websites. Components, blocks, layouts and complete page generation.

### Why we built it

After repeatedly encountering the same challenges in our companyâ€™s client projects, we decided to build this library. After successfully using it in production websites, we decided to open-source it to help others facing similar problems.
